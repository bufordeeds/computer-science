## Algorithm Techniques

### Divide & Conquer
- Recursion technique that takes larger problems in sub problems to eventually come to a solution.

**Classic example: Binary Search**
- Time Complexity: O(logN) since you are always splitting the search. Reducing work every search.  
- If you have a sorted array... It's going to be binary search.

**Steps**
1. Define base case.
2. Divide: Break down to a sub-problem.
3. Conquer: Work on each sub-problem and get it solved
4. Combine: Final solution or output.
