/*
What is functional programming?
- Design pattern
- FP is breaking up your code into like verbs (thinking in terms of the action)
- OOP is like the noun
- FP Advantage: Dealing with pure functions so less side effect. Hence, less error prone. 
- But in the real world, especially in the web, there are tons of side of effects and pure functions are almost impossible some times.
